# CAR PRICE PREDICTION USA

## Question/need:

The microchip shortage has slowed production of new vehicles, funneling buyers instead to used cars,trucks and SUVs. Prices for pre-owned models have risen significantly as a result.
Car prices have risen for a variety of reasons, but they all boil down to two factors: high demand and limited supplies.   

## Purpose of the model/system:

Used-car prices have continued their steady upward climb this year as new-car shortages put increased pressure on the used market. The most recent Consumer Price Index report, from August 2021 shows that prices were up almost 32 percent over a year earlier.

To be able to predict used cars market value can help both buyers and sellers. Deciding whether a used car is worth the posted price when you see listings online can be difficult.
Several factors, including mileage, make, model, year, etc. can influence the actual worth of a car. Based on existing data, the aim is to use machine learning algorithms to develop models for predicting used car prices.

## Data Description:


- For this project, the data is collected from Craigslist, Craigslist is the worldâ€™s largest collection of used vehicles for sale. The features available in this dataset are Mileage, Make, Model, Year, State and City ,using which we can predict the price of a used car given a variety of features like (manufacturer, model, condition, state, city, year)

- Goal is to make a *Model* which can give an estimate of the price that should be intended for the used cars, based on historical data.
